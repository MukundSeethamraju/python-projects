washington  president joe biden outlined his efforts to fight inflation and lower consumer prices in a speech from the white house on tuesday looking to address a top concern of voters ahead of the midterms

i believe inflation is our top economic challenge right now said biden who did not announce any new policy initiatives

inflation which is at its highest levels in decades has become a top concern for voters republicans have sought to blame bidens policies for rising prices while the president has attributed inflation to pandemicrelated shutdowns that disrupted the global supply chain along with russias invasion of ukraine

those two major contributors to inflation are both global in nature biden said thats why were seeing historic inflation in countries all over the world

in a glimpse of a favored white house midterm message biden sought to contrast his agenda with that of sen rick scott rfla scott who chairs the senate republicans campaign arm released an point plan in february for gop candidates to run on in the upcoming midterms the plan calls for raising federal income taxes on many americans banning debt ceiling increases unless america is at war and requiring all federal programs to expire every five years unless they are renewed by congress

his plan put him at odds with senate minority leader mitch mcconnell rky who opposes parts of scotts agenda that would increase income taxes on lowerincome americans and sunset social security and medicare within five years

republicans in congress are so deeply committed to protecting big corporations and ceos that theyd rather see taxes on working american families biden said

asked about biden going after his point plan and biden say he would be putting it up on the white house website scott stood by it i hope he puts it up on his website he told nbc news he has no idea how to fix anything

biden blamed republicans aligned with former president donald trump for blocking policy efforts that he said would have helped lower costs

let me say this carefully i never expected the ultramaga republicans who seem to control the republican party now to have been able to control the republican party biden said i never anticipated that happening

biden said he had no timeline for when inflation would subside citing economists who say it will slow by the end of the year though others say it could continue to rise in 

the president discussed the rising gas prices that have been stoked in part by russias war in ukraine  what he has called putins price hike  and his effort to lower them by releasing  million barrels of oil per day from the strategic petroleum reserve

they have no plan they have no plan to bring down energy prices today no plan to get us to a cleaner energy independent future biden said of republicans

biden called on congress to pass measures included in the build back better plan that democrats were unable to advance last year because of opposition from sen joe manchin dwva those include lowering child care and longterm care costs funding the construction of  million affordable homes through tax credits and passing clean energy and vehicle tax credits that would allow families to save money on their utility bills

i want every american to know im taking inflation very seriously and it is my top domestic priority biden said

meanwhile some economists are warning about a possible recession though many say its not imminent or inevitable to try to slow inflation the federal reserve raised interest rates last week by  percent

despite the high costs facing americans the us labor market has remained strong with the latest report from april showing that  jobs were added that month  a greater increase than predicted wages have also risen while the unemployment rate stands at  percent
