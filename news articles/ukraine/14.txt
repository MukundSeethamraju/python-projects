malaya rohan ukraine  when the wind blows a certain way the unmistakable stench of death wafts over the ruins of christina suslovas house

thats because the body of a russian soldier is rotting in a basement next door he was apparently killed during a string of ukrainian military offensives in recent weeks that have pushed moscows forces away from kharkiv ukraines secondlargest city

they looted they destroyed everything look inside theres nothing suslova  said standing outside her wrecked home in the village of malaya rohan some  miles east of central kharkiv

ukrainians living in and around the city are only now beginning to count the cost of the destruction wrought by weeks of russian shelling and occupation

malaya rohan still looks  and smells  like a war zone despite being liberated from occupation several weeks ago

a crate of russian munitions in suslovas front yard appeared to be the only thing not smashed or broken villagers said there were other russian corpses in the area

a stray dog trotted by with a bone the origins of which were unclear

a few doors down from suslovas house sergey ous a security guard and his family painstakingly sifted through the rubble of their home clearing the debris brick by brick a flattened car sat atop the wreckage possibly crushed and pushed aside by a russian tank

im in shock it took me eight years to build this house and ive only lived in it for two years ous  said

in a perverse approximation of suburbia armored vehicles sat in the driveways of some the houses down the street the wellappointed homes apparently used by russian troops as a base

its hard to tell what damage was caused by russian occupation and what was caused by ukrainian shelling to end it

villagers blame the russians

we didnt ask them to come we didnt know theyd do such things we didnt want them here said suslovas grandmother viktorivna vasylyeva  gesticulating angrily

erratic tank tracks and collision damage to vehicles and buildings may point to a desperate russian scramble to escape their turrets blown off the tanks gutted shells now dot the village

a downed russian helicopter its z marking still visible on the tail piece lies in a field near ludmila terekhs home the yearold grandmother said she blamed russians occupying the house next to hers for attracting the shelling that caved in her roof

we were brothers and neighbors before we fought in the second world war together i dont know why they came vasylyeva said crying and motioning with her hands wildly

i worked all my life for that house and all my family lived there  my kids my grandkids now i dont know what to do she added

lowflying ukrainian military helicopters buzzed by her home making multiple passes

the dull thud and crunch of russian shelling could still be heard in the distance but now moscows troops are too far from central kharkiv to easily threaten the city

their retreat came too late for kira seroshtan  who was lying in a hospital bed in kharkiv regional hospital

she had been walking with two friends in a kharkiv park on april  before seeing a white flash

i turned to look at my friends one was wounded in the chest and the other got shrapnel in the eye and in the head i started to scream for help seroshtan said

the friend with the head injuries was killed while the other friend survived shrapnel tore through kiras abdomen and legs

she lifted her hospital blanket to reveal ugly green stitching across her body where shrapnel had been removed and where she had had a colostomy operation

despite the lifechanging injuries seroshtan was still smiling and cheerful

now ive been here one month i realize i cant postpone things i cant wait its now a new phase of my life she said

im alive and its a miracle

she took out a piece of gauze from a drawer by her bed and carefully unwrapped a piece of the metal that had been removed from her body

ill keep it with me and every year on april  ill take it out and look at it seroshtan said

that day will be like my second birthday
