seattlewashington may  reuters  us airsafety regulators have told boeing the documentation it submitted to win approval to resume  deliveries to airlines after a year is incomplete two people familiar with the matter said

the us federal aviation administration faa identified a number of omissions in boeings documentation submitted in late april and has sent portions of it back to the planemaker one of the people said

a second person said it was too early to say whether faa concerns would lead to a new delay in resuming deliveries which have been suspended for the past year due to production flaws

boeing chief executive dave calhoun highlighted the submission in the companys april  earnings call calling it a very important step and saying it was preparing the first s for delivery but stopped short of providing a date

people briefed on the matter say the submission was made shortly before the call

a boeing spokesperson said the company continues to have a transparent dialogue and work closely with the faa on the remaining steps

an faa spokesman declined to elaborate saying only safety drives the pace of our reviews

clearing a swollen inventory of twinaisled dreamliners and its bestselling  max jets is vital to the us planemakers ability to emerge from the overlapping pandemic and jetsafety crises a task complicated by supplychain bottlenecks and war in ukraine

deliveries of the  have been halted for a year as boeing worked through inspections and repairs in an industrial headache expected to cost about  billion boeing has more than  of the advanced composite twinaisle jets parked in inventory worth about  billion

in february the faa said it would not allow boeing to selfcertify individual new boeing  planes thenfaa administrator steve dickson said the agency needed from boeing a systemic fix to their production processes theyve got to produce the quality on their production line that were looking for and that theyve committed to

the faa said in february it would retain the authority to issue airworthiness certificates until it is confident boeings quality control and manufacturing processes consistently produce s that meet faa design standards

reuters reported in late april that boeing has advised key airlines and parts suppliers that deliveries would resume in the second half of this year with one industry source saying deliveries could resume in a matter of weeks

boeings certification package is a sprawling set of documents and data that shows the jets compliance though the faa controls the final determination the package lays out inspections and repairs boeing will undertake on dozens of planes sidelined by production flaws the documentation is a crucial step before boeing can resume deliveries

boeings chief financial officer brian west made upbeat comments on the s progress at a goldman sachs conference this week

this certification plan submission was an important milestone and it reflects a very thorough comprehensive set of documents that verifies that we are in conformance west said and theres been an enormous amount of work into that working side by side with the faa along the way

boeing suspended deliveries of the  in late may  after the faa raised concerns about its proposed inspection method the regulatory agency had issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for inservice airplanes and identified a new issue in july

ill remind you that we havent really seen anything new in a while west added so were working hard on making sure that that submission is thorough and now the faa has it and we are standing by ready and willing to enter any discussion answer any question and help them do their work as they move through their certain protocols
