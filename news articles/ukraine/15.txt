washington  after a weeklong delay the senate voted thursday to pass a  billion military economic and humanitarian aid package for ukraine as its bloody war with russia neared the threemonth mark

the vote was  with republicans casting all of the no votes the senate also voted to confirm bridget brink to be the us ambassador to ukraine on wednesday night shortly after the state department announced it was reopening its embassy in kyiv

democratic and republican leaders had hoped to quickly take up the housepassed package last week but sen rand paul rky objected and dragged out the process over a dispute about oversight of the spending

thursdays big bipartisan vote which sends the aid package to president joe bidens desk for his signature is an unmistakable signal to kyiv that the us remains firmly in its corner pauls stall tactics miffed many colleagues who had warned that ukraine is dangerously close to running out of weapons food and other supplies

the aid package is extremely critical it was critical last week said senate appropriations chairman patrick leahy dvt who added and i cannot believe that some on the republican side have held it up every day its delayed it impacts the war effort

paul a fiscal conservative known for his isolationist views had failed to reach a deal with senate majority leader chuck schumer dny over his demands paul wanted language in the bill to create a special inspector general position to oversee all ukraine spending he suggested that john f sopko who was a us watchdog for afghanistan reconstruction over the past decade could do the job

schumer proposed holding a vote on an amendment to create the position but paul rejected the offer

weve already got the best solution and that is a special inspector who has a track record paul said this week we think the special inspector from afghanistan would be ideal  hes ready to go they can do the job but any other alternative we think falls short

in the end no new language was added to the housepassed bill which includes provisions to fund oversight of spending at the defense and state departments and the us agency for international development

all opposition came from gop lawmakers when the legislation passed the house in a  vote this month on thursday paul and  other senate republicans voted against the aid package

the others who voted no were sens marsha blackburn of tennessee john boozman of arkansas mike braun of indiana mike crapo of idaho bill hagerty of tennessee josh hawley of missouri mike lee of utah cynthia lummis of wyoming roger marshall of kansas and tommy tuberville of alabama

the biggest parts are  billion to replenish us stocks of military equipment sent to ukraine nearly  billion for european command operations including intelligence support and hardship pay for troops deployed to the region billions of dollars to address food shortages and the impact of rising food prices and billions more in humanitarian aid for ukrainian refugees

it represents the largest aid package for ukraine to date and it would bring to more than  billion the amount of aid the us has given to ukraine since russia invaded on feb 

but given the scale of the war effort schumer and other lawmakers said they are not certain it will be the last tranche

the ukrainians are valiant theyre making progress schumer told reporters pointing to successful campaigns in the kharkiv region in northeast ukraine theyre doing the fighting theyre the ones getting killed theyre the ones struggling and suffering the least we can do is give them the weaponry they need

asked whether the ukrainians will need more us aid after this batch sen richard shelby of alabama the top gop appropriator said probably probably probably europes going to be involved and that will be led by the germans  theyre the richest country over there

senate minority leader mitch mcconnell rky led a small delegation of gop senators to meet with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy over the weekend in kyiv gop sens john cornyn of texas john barrasso of wyoming and susan collins of maine joined mcconnell in ukraine

this is not some handout mcconnell told reporters after the trip saying the aid is needed to help repel russian president vladimir putin this is to prevent this ruthless thug from beginning a march through europe the first place to do that is in ukraine and thats what were determined to do

but as the war has raged on congressional republicans have grown more and more divided over assistance for ukraine

braun said he opposed the legislation for two reasons it is not paid for with offsets and the european union has not provided matching funds

with this rush to do it ourselves is the eu matching us theyre not and that is a valid question you know that its in their own backyard braun told reporters if it would have been paid for and the eu was matching it i would have voted for it
