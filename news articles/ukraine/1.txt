how well is the american consumer holding up against skyhigh inflation it depends on whom you ask

four major retailers  walmart target home depot and lowes  reported quarterly financial results this week and they each offered a different perspective on where and how people are spending their money

walmart said some of its more pricesensitive customers are beginning to trade down to privatelabel brands while home depot emphasized the resiliency among its customer base a sizable percentage of which is professional home builders and contractors

the reports came after amazon in late april flashed warning signs for the retail industry when it booked the slowest revenue growth for any quarter since the dotcom bust in  and offered up a bleak forecast

still expectations on wall street were higher this week for both walmart and target analysts and investors didnt anticipate that the two bigbox retailers would take such a massive hit to their profits in the latest period as supply chain costs weighed on sales and unwanted inventory such as tvs and kitchen appliances piled up walmart closed tuesday down  marking its worst day since october  on wednesday walmart fell another  while target had its worst day in  years

home depot and lowes though have seen more strength among shoppers in recent weeks

our customers are resilient we are not seeing the sensitivity to that level of inflation that we would have initially expected home depot ceo ted decker said tuesday on the companys earnings call shares of both home improvement chains closed wednesday down about  amid a broader market selloff

the mixed commentary from these retailers is in large part due to the fact that americans are experiencing economic volatility differently dependent upon their income levels companies and consumers are in an uncharted transition period following months of covidrelated lockdown measures that prompted purchases of canned goods toilet paper and peloton bikes to soar multiple rounds of stimulus dollars fueled spending on new sneakers and electronics

but as that money dries up retailers must navigate their new normal that includes inflation at year highs russias war in ukraine and a stillcrippled global supply chain

while weve experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years us inflation being this high and moving so quickly both in food and general merchandise is unusual walmart chief executive officer doug mcmillon said tuesday on an earnings conference call

the results this week could foreshadow trouble for a number of retailers including macys kohls nordstrom and gap which have yet to report results for the first quarter of  these companies that rely on consumers coming inside their stores to splurge on new clothes or shoes could be particularly pressured as walmart hinted that shoppers were beginning to pull back on discretionary items to budget more money toward groceries

at the same time retailers are citing an uptick in demand for items such as luggage dresses and makeup as more americans plan vacations and attend weddings but the concern is that consumers will be forced to make tradeoffs somewhere in order to afford these things or theyll seek out discounted goods at shops such as tj maxx

heres what walmart target home depot and lowes are telling us about the state of the american consumer

walmart

walmart is seeing a mixed picture shaped by consumers household income and how they feel about the future but in the most recent quarter the nations largest retailer said shoppers are showing they are mindful of the budget

customers walked out of stores and left the retailers website with fewer purchased items more of them skipped over new clothing and other general merchandise as they saw prices rise on gas and groceries some traded down to cheaper brands or smaller items including halfgallons of milk and the store brand of lunch meat instead of a pricier brandname one chief financial officer brett biggs told cnbc

on the other hand he said some customers have sprung for new patio furniture or eagerly chased the flashy new gaming console he said

if you look at the demographics of the us and lay our customer map on top of it wed be really close to the same thing biggs said and so youve got some people who are going to feel more pressure than others and i think thats what were seeing

target

target said it is seeing a resilient consumer who have new priorities as the pandemic becomes more of an afterthought

theyre shifting from buying tvs to buying luggage chief executive officer brian cornell said in an interview on cnbcs squawk box he added later theyre still shopping but they started to spend dollars differently

that change showed up with purchases in the fiscal first quarter he said customers bought decor and gifts for easter and mothers day celebrations they threw and attended larger childrens birthday parties  leading to a jump in toy sales they also bought fewer items like bicycles and small kitchen appliances as they booked flights and planned trips

cornell pointed to the high spending levels that target went up against in the yearago first quarter as americans got money from stimulus checks and had fewer places to spend it

comparable sales still grew despite that challenging comparison he noted plus traffic at targets store and website traffic rose nearly  year over year sales growth numbers however would include the effects of inflation which is making everything from freight costs to groceries pricier

target last quarter also had a higher level of markdowns a staple of the retail industry that more or less disappeared during the pandemic as shoppers had a big appetite to buy and retailers had less merchandise to put on shelves

home depot

the home improvement retailer told investors on tuesday that it wasnt seeing any differences in consumer behavior yet

home depots average ticket climbed  in the quarter fueled largely by inflation but executives also said that consumers are trading up not trading down for example consumers are switching from gaspowered lawn mowers to more expensive batterypowered options according to home depots vice president of merchandising jeff kinnaird

this behavior likely is due to the fact that the overwhelming majority of home depot customers are homeowners who have seen their home equity values soar in the last two years cfo richard mcphail said on the call that more than  of its doityourself customers own their homes while basically all of its sales to contractors are on behalf of a homeowner

mcphail also said that roughly  of its customers with mortgages have fixed rates as interest rates and housing prices rise consumers who consider moving are opting instead to stay in their current homes and remodel them instead

lowes

lowes echoed similar sentiments during its conference call on wednesday ceo marvin ellison said home price appreciation the aging home stock and the ongoing housing shortage are key economic drivers of lowes business

its one of the reasons why i think home improvement is a unique retail sector and can have this macro environment where there are a lot of questions about the health of the consumer he told analysts

consumers working on diy projects account for about three quarters of lowes sales which is a higher proportion than rival home depot so far the company isnt seeing any material trade down from those consumers yet

however consumers are starting to feel the pinch from rising energy prices ellison told cnbc that lowes customers are trading up to batterypowered landscaping tools and lawnmowers and more fuelefficient laundry machines

do i think it has something to do with fuel prices the answer is absolutely he said

lowes did fall short of wall streets expectations for its quarterly sales but executives chalked up the retailers disappointing performance to weather
