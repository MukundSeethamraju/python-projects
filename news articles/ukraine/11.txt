the federal reserve lifted its core interest rate by  percent on wednesday  its second hike in two months and the largest increase since   as the central bank works to fight inflation levels that have reached year highs

the widely expected move which puts the federal funds rate closer to  up from  comes as the fed seeks to cool off a pandemic recovery that has produced stellar job growth but that has come against a backdrop of soaring prices across a range of goods and services from gas to real estate labor too has gotten more expensive fueling shortages and putting pressure on the fed to slow companies expansion plans

the committee is highly attentive to inflation risks the feds open market committee said in its may statement on wednesday adding that it anticipates additional rate hikes will be necessary it cited russias invasion of ukraine and pandemic lockdowns in china as causes of ongoing economic uncertainty and factors that are likely to keep inflation elevated

in his press conference following the statements release wednesday fed chair pro tempore jerome powell said inflation is much too high and said the central bank would seek to move expeditiously to return inflation to a  annual rate however powell seemed to rule out pursuing interest rate hikes that are higher than  at future meetings

thanks to prior comments by fed chairman jerome powell and other fed officials in the runup to wednesdays announcement higher rates have already begun to show up in everyday borrowing transactions for products including homes and autos according to gus faucher senior vice president and chief economist of the pnc financial services group

where were more likely to see them higher rates show up now in is shortterm borrowing costs faucher said so oneyear adjustablerate mortgages cd certificate of deposit rates may move up a little bit

while surging prices have historically come amid sputtering economic growth many economists see the uss current financial picture as one that has been able to largely absorb recent leaps in the cost of goods

still there remains some concern that the fed has fallen behind when it comes to fighting inflation and that it could end up having to raise rates so aggressively that it ends up tipping the economy into a recession as economists at bank of america wrote in a note to investors monday markets believe the fed may have to set the federal funds rate beyond  percent to cool down inflation by making it more expensive to borrow

some economists were encouraged by data monday that showed a slowdown in us manufacturing activity as one reason why the fed may not have to be as aggressive in raising rates as some have feared in recent months ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics is among those who believe inflation likely peaked in march meaning the fed will be able to slow its pace of interest rate hikes

in a note to clients monday shepherdson also cited the rollover in housing demand the impending steep drop in inflation and the broad tightening of financial conditions as arguments against endless rate hikes none of this will prevent a  basis point hike wednesday or likely in june but we are on the alert for markets to start scaling back their expectations for midsummer onwards

but pncs faucher said he believes a recession could still come in the next  months or so he puts the odds that the economy goes into reverse at about  in 

the fed may decide we need to experience a mild recession to bring down wageinflationary pressures faucher said but the good news is starting from a very good place in the labor market

as a result faucher said job losses are more likely to be concentrated in areas like housing and other durable goods that are interestrate sensitive as opposed to services consumption

still he said the next few years are likely to be turbulent

right now the economy looks good faucher said weve got good job growth good consumer spending growth so we are not in imminent danger of a recession  but the risk is elevated and even if we dont get a recession things are going to be bumpy the next couple of years
