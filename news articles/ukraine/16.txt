seoul  president joe biden on friday begins his first trip to asia since he took office amid some of his lowest domestic approval numbers as he looks to make strides in countering chinas saberrattling and economic influence in the indopacific region

biden is scheduled to spend two days in south korea where hell showcase new economic investments in the us by some of the countrys top companies including hyundais plans to open a plant in georgia

he then plans to fly to tokyo for a meeting of an alliance among the us australia japan and india thats aimed at checking chinas increasing military might

the war in ukraine looms over bidens fourday trip to the other side of the globe with leaders planning to press indian president narendra modi to take a firm position against russias invasion and the us hoping the global response to moscows aggression might deter china from moving on taiwan

the message were trying to send on this trip is a message of an affirmative vision of what the world can look like if the democracies and open societies of the world stand together bidens national security adviser jake sullivan told reporters wednesday we think that message will be heard everywhere we think it will be heard in beijing

also potentially overshadowing bidens trip is growing concern within the administration that north korea could conduct a nuclear test or launch an intercontinental ballistic missile to coincide with his visit us officials have said intelligence shows that either or both is possible if either happens it would be the first time north korea has taken such a step in several years

sullivan told reporters before bidens departure that the administration was prepared to make both short and longerterm adjustments to our military posture as necessary to try to deter pyongyang from further provocation and defend us allies in the region

at the same time the us is keeping open the possibility for diplomatic dialogue with north korea while noting that there has been scant contact and it could extend an offer to assist with a covid outbreak in the isolated country including by providing vaccines

biden notably isnt scheduled to visit the demilitarized zone that divides north korea and south korea the white house didnt explain why white house officials said the focus of the trip is economic initiatives pointing out that biden did visit the demilitarized zone as vice president

biden does plan to visit with us troops in the region

while he is in seoul biden is scheduled to meet with south korean president yoon sukyeol who was recently elected and attend a state dinner hes expected to visit a samsung factory as part of his emphasis on efforts in south koreas technology and manufacturing industries to take more of their operations  and jobs  to the us

biden also plans to announce a new economic initiative the indopacific economic framework which the white house says is aimed at expanding trade fortifying supply chains and tackling climate change

the asia tour kicks off by highlighting new foreign investments in the us economy as the administration looks to stress an economic message when the overwhelming majority of americans   percent in the latest nbc news poll  believe the country is on the wrong track

only  percent of all respondents and just  percent of independents in that poll said they approved of bidens handling of the economy

a significant part of the visit to tokyo is expected to be a meeting with the leaders of the socalled quad an alliance of the us india australia and japan in addition to meeting with his host japanese prime minister fumio kishida biden is also expected to hold oneonone meetings with modi and the winner of saturdays australian election

biden officials have worked to grow the quad into a more substantive economic and military force that coupled with new economic initiatives is designed to send a message to china

michael green an asia expert at the center for strategic and international studies a washington dcbased think tank told reporters before bidens trip that the subtext of the quad is that this is a powerful alignment of maritime democracies concerned about security and stability and the balance of power as china asserts itself

biden has repeatedly argued that the st century will be defined by the contest between democracies like the us and autocracies like russia and china

his trip to asia is designed to illustrate that just as he has intensively worked this year to maintain unity among european allies in the face of russias aggression in ukraine he can build a similar network of partners in the eastern hemisphere as a buffer against china  particularly any considerations of exercising its expanding military might

china even more than russia has been central to bidens foreign policy approach over the past decade since he traveled to beijing as vice president to hold the first extensive meetings with chinas future president xi jinping

and as the administration has considered the joint actions against russia that have dominated its foreign policy agenda this year it has done so mindful that china would be watching every move
