questions about whether a recession may be on the horizon are resurfacing in light of comments made by goldman sachs senior chairman lloyd blankfein who said there is a narrow path for the economy to dip into an economic slowdown

blankfein made the remarks in an interview sunday adding that the federal reserve has powerful tools to help cool down the economy enough to bring inflation down without inducing a recession one of those tools is a higher core interest rate which the central bank raised by  percent earlier this month

its definitely a risk blankfein said of a potential recession but he suggested that its not a foregone conclusion

if i were running a big company i would be very prepared for it he said if i were a consumer id be prepared for it  but its not baked in the cake

analysts are working to digest a host of signals about the state of the us economy which emerged from a pandemic recession stronger than anyone could have believed

some of those alarming trends recently collided with another major data point showing us gross domestic product shrank in the first quarter of 

still many economists believe a formal recession  the economy going into reverse for two consecutive quarters  is not imminent

this is noise not signal wrote ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics research group of the gdp data in a note to clients the economy is not falling into recession

that sentiment was echoed by bill adams chief economist at comerica bank who noted in a tweet that consumer spending investment and job growth remain healthy

still many americans are feeling jittery among the signs searches for recession have been spiking on google this month

google trend data showing searches for recession surging in april google

there are undoubtedly a lot of challenges for the us economy said james knightley chief international economist at the financial services group ing youve got a situation where households are feeling the squeeze of higher fuel and food costs and wages that are not necessarily keeping pace

recent consumer sentiment readings also suggest many americans arent sure where their financial futures are headed complicating matters the ultralow interest rate environment that has dominated the us economy for years has come to an end with the federal reserve poised to hike its key benchmark rate next week for the second time in nearly two months

as a result while most economists are certain that growth will begin slowing in the coming months there is debate about how severe the drop will be and what it all means for average americans

people are feeling cautious  and weve just started to get higher interest rates knightley said its unnerving for people

warning signals

in late april the us bureau of economic analysis reported the us gross domestic product among the broadest measures of growth observed by economists shrank  percent gdp represents the market value of goods and services produced in a country during a specific period of time

yet many economists were unfazed by the negative direction of the data saying it was mostly a quirk of technical factors in how gdp is calculated

in particular the data were heavily affected by a surge in imported goods  a sign that demand actually remains quite strong

because there was such a huge backlog of ships waiting to unload in american ports imports stayed high in the first quarter comericas bill adams said meaning america was in a trade deficit so it showed up as a reduction in gdp which meant purchasers were going to buy more foreign products and less american products

but there are other signals suggesting all may not be well in the economy at the end of march a key part of the bond market associated with recessions reared its head its known as an inverted yield curve its what happens when it becomes riskier to hold shortterm bonds than it is to hold longerterm ones

according to the federal reserve bank of san francisco inverted yield curves have preceded every recession since  though sometimes its taken two years for an economic contraction to arrive after an inversion has occurred

only once in the s has the curve inverted and a recession not followed soon after

on march  the yield curve inverted  meaning bondbuyers decided shorterterm risks to economic growth were increasing relative to longerterm ones

ings knightley said this doesnt rule out a recession entirely but its a flashing warning sign that we need to take seriously

experts like knightley worry that if the warning sign is correct average americans could start to experience higher unemployment and slower wage growth even as inflation begins to slow down

a steepening yield curve has been a feature of our economic environment in recent months

where will inflation go from here

its not clear when an inflation slowdown will happen or how fast some economists believe inflation peaked in march when the consumer price index hit a year high

yet many economists believe inflation is likely to linger for some time in a note to clients released in early may bank of america said recession risks are low now but elevated in  as inflation could force the fed to hike until it hurts

the bank is referring to the plan by the federal reserve to raise interest rates to bring inflation under control the fed has said it would raise the benchmark interest rate several more times in this year meaning the cost of borrowing money  to buy houses cars take out student loans and carry credit card debt  will become more expensive

every recession is different but fed hikes and commodity shocks have played a role in most recessions over the last few decades the bank wrote currently we are facing a modest version of both a commodity shock from the russiaukraine war and a significant fed tightening moreover the commodity price spike is part of a much broader surge in inflation

at the moment the bank said the main imbalances in the economy are elevated spending on goods and what it called a potentially overheating labor market

at the moment it said inflation is weighing heavily on real consumer spending which has climbed just  percent yearonyear over the past three quarters despite this the gdp data show spending is still strong with some exceptions mortgage applications recently fell to their lowest levels in the postcovid era due in large part to higher interest rates

but inflation could persist if overall consumer demand remains too strong thanks to the redhot labor market and the covidrelated lockdowns in china that are affecting supply chains again bank of america said

economic risks are elevated and should certainly be viewed as above average the bank said if inflation comes in stronger than expected or growth falls quickly a recession would become the base case but we are not there yet

how should households prepare for a potential recession

goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius pointed out in an april  note to investors that household balance sheets are healthy

the household net worthdisposable income ratio is currently at a record high hatzius said citing stock market highs through much of  and the record amount of money people saved up during the pandemic the private sector overall is running a healthy financial surplus hatzius said

this means that a slowdown in income growth due to a monetary policyinduced cut in labor demand is less likely to force households to cut back sharply on spending hatzius added  meaning families will likely keep enjoying the ability to spend money on what they need and want because their financial balance sheets are so healthy right now

this likely raises odds of avoiding a recession he said

so what can consumers do to prepare for a recession ironically it is the fear of a downturn that can often trigger one

planning for a recession is the ideal cocktail to end up with a recession said gregory daco chief economist at eyparthenon ernst  young llp so it oftentimes becomes a selffulfilling prophecy consumers start to purchase less or retrench and then businesses start facing more financial difficulties they start to hire less then incomes fall it leads back into vicious loop

ultimately he said it will fall on the fed to nail the economic dismount right now he said a recession is not imminent but depending on what the fed does  and how markets respond  a recession could be a possibility in the next couple of years

while a recession is a risk it is not a guarantee daco said there is no guarantee we end up in a recession because the fed will be able to rethink recalibrate monetary policy but it is a risk as we look into 

so a bit of ageold advice remains true for individuals and families looking to fortify their finances before a recession have an emergency savings account use no more than about  percent of your available credit pay down highinterest debt and be mindful of spending on nonessential goods and services
