the inflation rate was little changed from march to april a potential sign that the rapid growth in the cost of goods and services may soon taper off

consumer prices rose by  percent in april after having risen by  percent in march according to data the bureau of labor statistics released wednesday compared with one year ago the inflation rate grew by  percent in april the number in march was  percent

aprils core inflation measure  the change in the price of goods and services not including food and energy  was  percent compared to  percent in march

the numbers indicate that inflation which has been sitting at a year high since december is showing signs of cooling off but some experts warn that it may be too soon to tell where inflation goes from here

and households are still feeling the squeeze of rising prices the largest increases for april were in airfares food including meat and bread shelter and new vehicles

airfares climbed nearly by  percent in the month the research group capital economics noted that airfares have surged by nearly  percent over the past three months  likely reflecting higher fuel costs it said

although gas prices in april declined by  percent over the previous month prices at the pump were already back at alltime highs this week  recent information not reflected in wednesdays data release

economists said after the bls report was released wednesday that they remain concerned that prices are not decelerating as rapidly as had been hoped

the pace of price increases moderated but not as much as expected greg mcbride the chief financial analyst at the financial services group bankratecom said in a note

excluding a decline in energy prices  which appears outdated by this point  the increases remain widespread with the annual rate ticking down from  percent to  percent it can be tempting to say weve seen the peak but weve also been headfaked before as was the case last august

the pickup in core inflation in april could mean the federal reserve will consider increasing interest rates more aggressively said andrew hunter a senior us economist at capital economics a research group

overall the april data will probably strengthen the feds resolve to continue hiking rates by  percent at the next couple of meetings  and could lead to renewed speculation about a  percent hike or an intermeeting move hunter wrote in a new note to clients but with goods shortages tentatively easing and signs that wage growth is set to cool we still think a more pronounced drop back in inflation will allow officials to slow the pace of tightening in the second half of the year

the fed has indicated that  percent interest rate hikes are not being actively considered

the biden administration and the federal reserve have both framed inflation as the top economic concern nationally last week the federal reserve announced it had raised its key interest rate by  percent as part of its effort to cool off the economy and more rate hikes are expected this year

president joe biden speaking tuesday about inflation highlighted steps the administration has taken to ease the burden on americans but he did not announce any new policy initiatives to address the issue biden said the inflationary environment is a global problem pointing to the war in ukraine and pandemicrelated supply chain issues as reasons for rising costs

were seeing historic inflation in countries all over the world biden said

in a note published before wednesdays data release mcbride of bankrate highlighted housing which he said accounts for  percent of the core consumer price index as it does for many household budgets he said referring to the proportion of household income that families spend to keep roofs over their heads

with doubledigit increases in rents kicking in this puts the household budget in a vise even if food and energy costs level out he said

mcbride also noted that mortgage rates have jumped by more than  percentage points this year

until we see sustained evidence of easing inflation pressures the risk is to the upside he said however when we do see inflation pressures simmer down mortgage rates will reverse course quickly  particularly if the economy is slowing too

mortgage prices have climbed this year but the year mortgage interest rate fell from  percent last week to  percent this week

wednesdays inflation numbers also arrived amid signs of moderating wage growth last week the bls reported that monthly wage growth had decelerated to  percent from  percent although on an annual basis it was unchanged at  percent growth  not enough to keep pace with inflation

at least one economist believes inflation peaked in march in a note to clients tuesday ian shepherdson the chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics a research group said that while at least one more  percent rate hike is likely for june the fed may pause in july

fed officials will remain cautious because they know the decline in inflation will slow in the third quarter shepherdson said but the pressure on policymakers to continue hiking by onehalf percent per meeting wont be sustained at its current feverpitch when inflation is falling he said
